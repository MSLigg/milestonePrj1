Milestone Project 1: Browser Game

Game Requirements:
This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
The HTML code should use sematic tags

The game should have a Readme.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.

Directions adapted from HelpMyKidLearn.ie (https://www.helpmykidlearn.ie/activities/5-7/detail/memory-card-game)

The objective is to collect all the pairs of tiles.
There is a shuffle function built into the JS that will randomly place the tiles.

If you successfully match a pair, the tiles will stay face up you should try to match another.
When a player turns over two tiles that don't match, those tiles are turned face down again (in the same position) and you must try again.
The trick is to remember which cards are where.
